    <h1>About Me </h1>
    <p>I am a highly qualified and skilled cybersecurity professional with a Master's Degree in Computer Science specializing in Cybersecurity with Merit from a prestigious university in the UK. In 2022, I passed the CySA+, OSCP, and CRTP exams on my first attempts, demonstrating my in-depth knowledge and expertise in discovering and managing system vulnerabilities.</p>
  <p>In addition to my expertise in identifying flaws in software and assessing computer systems and networks' security, I am also capable of building websites and testing them. With my proficiency in manual testing, automated tools, and reverse engineering, I can easily uncover vulnerabilities that may go unnoticed by others. These skills make me a versatile professional, capable of enhancing an organization's overall security posture while also developing secure and robust web applications.</p>
